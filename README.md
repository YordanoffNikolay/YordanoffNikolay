Hi, I’m Nikolay, but guess you already know that!

My journey in software developemnt started somewhere in 2022 with some C# basics. Several months later I fugured out that Java is my way to go and by July 2023 I found myself at Telerik Academy Alpha Java Track. 

It's now 2024 and I'm a proud Telerik Academy graduate looking for his first opportunity to prove my knowlege. With my solid Java background, established work ethic and never-quenching knowledge thirst could I be the person you are looking for your team?

My tech skills in a nutshell: OOP, DSA, JUnit/Mockito, realtional databases, SQL, Web Development (HTML/CSS, REST). Docker next on the agenda as I identify it as a key missing knowledge never mentoned in my academy training.
